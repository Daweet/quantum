# Quantum Algorithms for Machine Learning

What do we mean when we talk about *quantum machine learning*? Und this term, algorithms and procedures are grouped that use quantum computation and quantum algorithms to speed up machine learning processes or parts of machine learning algorithms on a quantum computer.

To faciliate machine learning on a quantum computer, we will here take the approach of using quantum algorithms to speed up the underlying linear algebraic calculations done in machine learning algorithms.
